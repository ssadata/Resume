# Simón Salazar Albornoz 🦉 []

I am a social scientist with a degree in sociology 👨‍🎓. Methodical, communicative and with a strong focus on critical analysis of information. I specialize in social and environmental research. I like to train as a Python 🐍 programmer to intertwine it with my profession and thus contribute to solving everyday problems, whether they are labour or even social. I am passionate about technologies and the development in our societies, in order of that, I'm constantly seeking to update my knowledge and skills in order to keep pace. I seek to develop and become a professional to drive the technological transformations that public and private organizations require in this dynamic period we live in. I enjoy spending my afternoons with my children in our garden and orchard, from which we obtain beautiful products 🍅 🌽 to cook with love 💚.
