# Sim√≥n Salazar Albornoz ü¶â 

I am a social scientist with a degree in sociology üë®‚Äçüéì. Methodical, communicative and with a strong focus on critical analysis of information. I specialize in social and environmental research. I like to train as a Python üêç programmer to intertwine it with my profession and thus contribute to solving everyday problems, whether they are labour or even social. I am passionate about technologies and the development in our societies, in order of that, I'm constantly seeking to update my knowledge and skills in order to keep pace. I seek to develop and become a professional to drive the technological transformations that public and private organizations require in this dynamic period we live in. I enjoy spending my afternoons with my children in our garden and orchard, from which we obtain beautiful products üçÖ üåΩ to cook with love üíö.
